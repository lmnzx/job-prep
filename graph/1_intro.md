## Introduction to Graph

### Types
- Undirected Graph
A-B-C
|
F-D

- Directed Graph
has directed edges(can be bidirectional)
A->B->C

- Nodes
A,B,C... are nodes

- Edge
The connection between two nodes

### Cyles in a graph
start from a node and end at the same node then there is a cycle in the graph

#### DAG -> Directed Acyclic Graph is the most important type of graph

### Path
Contain a lot of nodes and each of them are reachable
1-2-3-5         1235 is a path
    |           12321 is not a path, the nodes are not repeated
    4

### Degree of a node
no. of edges entering or leaving the node

**property Total Degree of a graph = 2 x E**

For directed graphs
there is *Indegree* and *Outdegree*

### Edge Weight
